## Agenda

I'd like to call a general meeting for Tuesday night. A couple of things happening that we should discuss.

1.  Vote on allocation of some funding to repair the compressor donated by Richard. estimated at $400. (Bear to advise what is needed.)
2.  Discuss space improvement plans. Ideas:
Convert the co-working room into a large tool room (e.g. CNC, 3D printers, etc...).  This then creates some additional space in the green room for working on projects. 
Create a shadow wall in the new tool room for all of the tools. 
Clarify the purpose of the google hangout room. 
Moving the machine shop into Sean's old room
Converting Sean's storage room into a dark room
Installation of hot water systems in the main building and chem lab. 
5.  The new gate that has been installed and the plan to automate it.  
6.  Update on Sean.
7.  General update / security / housekeeping.
